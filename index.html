          <h3>Programming</h3>
          <p class="first-paragraph">Programming is a rewarding career as well as an engaging hobby for developers.
            If you keep the approach to programming as a hobby than a job, you will
            sharpen your skills in a practical way. It can also be a fantastic way to
            master any new programming language.</p>

          <h3>Gaming</h3>
          <p class="second-paragraph">Once gaming was regarded as something quite nerdish that only people who were really
            obsessed with everything tech related would understand or enjoy. Many people thought of it
            as simply a waste of time and some were even ashamed to admit they liked gaming.
            It’s safe to say that things have come a long way since then and now more and more
            people are drawn by the idea of playing video games.
            The stigma has been lifted and everyone is free to profess their love for gaming. </p>
